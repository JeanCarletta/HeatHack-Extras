    "Readings from the same sensor should be around 5 minutes apart.  At first we were lucky that the radio range is good and that the second sensor wasn't turned on too close to the half-way point between the first sensor's readings. That means we got a completely separated bimodal distribution of elapsed times and we could easily split the readings: if there was a short time between this reading and the next one (<2.5 minutes), it's from sensor 1  and if there's a long time (> 2.5 minutes), it's sensor 2 - unless it's more than 4.5 minutes, in which case we've missed a reading.   It's not worth worrying about the rest, we just mark them as \"risk points\" (green) for the human analyst to consider that the traces might be swapped.  There was a cluster around 5 minutes.  It was probably the same sensor as the previous reading, but there's enough chance something got power-cycled to consider them at risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After a reboot, there's a 50/50 chance the sensor traces will swap round and the best time intervals for swapping the bins changes - because it depends on how long it was between when the two devices were switched on.  Ideally, people would always try to keep it to around 2-3 minutes, but they don't.  That's why the histogram is now a mess.  We could re-analyse the data segmenting it by reboots, but in practice what we have is good enough for the venue to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability in time interval is only about 18s so we should usually be able to use this approach for separation - but the bins will get fuzzier the longer the system runs because the devices have a poor sense of time that drifts, especially in the cold."

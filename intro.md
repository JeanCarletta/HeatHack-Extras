# Intro

We use this website to show plots for venues that have fielded extra equipment.  Sometimes they have data from a clip-on electricity monitor, but usually it's data from a whole set of commercial temperature data loggers.  

If you prefer to plot your data in Excel, you can download your full data here by choosing the folder with your venue number:

- [Data CSV files](https://github.com/JeanCarletta/HeatHack-Extras/tree/master/)

Click on the folder for your venue to open it.  You will see the individual data files for the monitor locations.  Click on them one at a time to open the file.  For each one you'll see something like the image shows.  You can download the data as a CSV file using the download button.  In the image it is circled in red.  Click on the image to make it larger if you can't see what to do.

If you any issues, for instance, with the timestamp format, let us know - our Excel handles it natively, but yours may not.

We provide some example Excel and Google sheets that handle basic plotting.  In plotting temperature against a user diary, they assume an advanced feature, lambda functions, that is available in Google Sheets and the very latest version of Excel, but not earlier versions.

If you have improvements, please contribute them to the project for others to use.

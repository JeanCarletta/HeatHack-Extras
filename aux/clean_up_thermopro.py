# CLEAN_UP_THERMPRO.PY
#  Run locally before downsampling, although we aren't sure the cleanup technique is universal!!
#  * Gets rid of non-ascii characters
#  * Concatenates date and time fields
#  * TODO - get rid of any lines with a temp or rh of -.  These really mess up the plotting.
#  Sometimes we  also need to fix 12 vs 24 hr clock, but that takes judgment (although it's spottable that venues are colder at night...)


# EDIT THESE VARIABLES BEFORE RUNNING
